    <p> The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed only converted from one form of energy to another"
        and We all make mistakes, we all have moments we want back but what we do moving forward is what matters most.
        Growing up I generally regarded myself as fretful and curious about the world and longed for a platform to impact the world in innovative ways
        Started a legal ecommerce business at 17 till 18 then fell off
        
        However I learned you can never cut corners in life and it takes time dedication and patience 
        I decided to redirect my energy towards the wrong lifestyle and addictive personality to thinks 
        that can make a difference in this world. 
        I struggled and overcame these things experiences made me who I am today
        But these experiences gave me the ability to problem solve, think very creatively and in an innovative fashion, create relations through networking and businesses not telling on myself but my way was innovative enough I waI just took things one day at a time and s able to teach others how
        To implement my formula or business model, I have the stamina to be patient and to play the long game when I see potential in something, have been applying myself and using the tools and coping mechanisms from books . Learned how to code html and css in 4-5 months and learned how to day trade options and understood the psychological aspects of business and taking the time to.
        I went through a lot but the person I am today is nothing like who I once was. It took a lot of sweat, tears, blood to overcome my habits and also that way of thinking being used for the wrong purpose.<p>
