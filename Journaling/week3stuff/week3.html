    <h1> Week 3 (06/03/22 - 06/10/22) </h1></div>
    <div class="week3l">
        <p> Week- 3 Time is flying. I feel like I now have a much deeper and better knowledge, 
            and I can see a change in myself right now because of the deeper understanding I now have. 
            I feel a lot more comfortable, now than I had the very first day because of my understanding with the concepts, 
            and how the industry works, and also a lot more tools under my belt to use. 
            We reviewed and practiced prospect communication techniques, discussed prospect pain points, and discussed how to ask prospects questions using methodologies.
             These methods assisted me in visualizing how a discussion should be conducted, as well as understanding to other businesses because
            you can paint a picture by breaking down and evaluate individuals in order to have prospects open up to you
            and honestly psychologically it makes sense because of how you can make a connection
             and create rapport.  I see how it can be efficient and how it puts a focus on salespeople and prospects  which results in developing mutual trust.
              I also saw by implementing this method a sales representative will function as a counselor and ask questions to identify the majority of difficulties straight away.

             Earlier in the week, we discussed sales methods. 
              The notion of gap selling and how to put it into practice. 
           
            <div class="Spc"><image src="spectrum.png" alt="spectr"></image> <image src="gapselling.png"></image></div>
            I saw how effective it was, and when Sheila  demonstrated the scope of gap selling and broke it down, it gave me insight into being able to see what underlying problems there may be, as well as being able to create Discovery questions for prospects based on seeing those actual causes, which will also help me as an SDR 
            to the impact of the problem for the Saas and also it would help the prospect  see.
            We broke it down in a spectrum to see how it is demonstrated.     </p>
            <p> On Friday we had another course instructor, his name was
                On Friday, we had another course instructor, Ravi, who, like the others, was very kind, open, and instructive. 
                We went through all of the principles and practiced qualifying prospects with our groups throughout the week.

            <p> These scenarios have always allowed me to gain a new perspective on myself and what I can work on and, my flaws and talents,
                 and how the concept works. I tried implementing or sticking to a script I made on my notes and too be honest it went well
                 but I saw how informative I was because of past experiences but that was opposite of what I use to apply. Afterwards in the second
                 half Vivek joined us an alumni who attended Uvaro, he works currently as a business development representative at Hoppin really cool 
                 humble nice guy, He was really helpful to e in our group we did with him, and I was able to learn and witness 
                 how a cold call should be done ideally when he and Ravi performed. 
                 
                 Overall, they were quite helpful and informative, and it was a great way to close the week by picking their 
                 brains about what you should and shouldn't do, as well as how to accomplish it. Afterward 
                  I was able to practice on what I recognized I was doing wrong.
