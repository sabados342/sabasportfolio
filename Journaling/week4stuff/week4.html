  <div class="closess">
        <p> 
            Last week! Crazy how time flew in a short amount of time while learning so much 
            and understanding it. On Monday the class was ran with Ravi again we went over negotiation
            techniques. We also practiced on group scenarios with building rapport and showing us. We started off with cloaing deals and how to do them.
            <div class="C21"><image src="closetech.png"></image></div> <p>he was going over different concepts or methods on how to apply them based on the feeling of 
                the atmosphere of the conversation. It gave me a better different perspective on how to handle situations that are more efficient.</p> <div class="c20"><image src="assumptive close.png"></image> <image src="compelling.png"></image> <image src="language.png"></image></div>
                <p>Finally we had group work as usual </p> <div class="C21"><image src="Groupwork.png" ></image></div> <p> So the questions I drafted were</p> <p> 1. How do you feel about what we have discussed so far?<br>
                2.What do you think of the solution I have shared with you ?<br> 3. Correct me if I am wrong, it sounds like you guys are ready to go?. Is there anything else that we need to address before we move forward? </p>

                <p> 
                    When Sheila returned on Tuesday we were discussing and practicing Disco demos and it's significance to how establishing the connection with the other individual through a normal interaction mixed with professionalism and 
                    how it can create a pipeline versuses just being overly informative about the product. The same thing I did the week before when we did a group work cold call simulation. It simply taught me how to use methods and techniques to ascertain whether there is anything that any SAAS company I may represent and their services, as well as how to collect data and ask questions in a specific tone, as well as wording them in a conditional manner, to determine 
                    if indeed the Software could be deployed also and fix a problem. We also discussed some more tips for discodemos and Sheila quickly discussed each bulletpoint from her experience. The one that I think gave me some insight the bulletpoint "With consent, try and record demo(future learnings, information recell" definitely 
                    good for learning about and what I can improve on. <div class="C23"><image src="Bestpractice.png"> <image src="Demoo.png"></image></div>

                </p>
               
                <p>
                  We all used the Demo flowmap that was provided and then
                    we filled them and practiced setting demos up within pairs which came out to be helpful. This was my flowmap.
                    We basically used this flowmap in order to practice scheduling demos. 
                    <div class="C24"><image src="prepdemo.png"> </div> <p>So my cohort memeber I was scheduled with we basicallyu both practiced twice and I struggled with
                        closing at first but overall I was told by my partner etc. that everything else was good delivery, and execution. 
                    </p>
                </p>
                <p>We spent the remainder of the week 
                    practicing Disco Demos and using our flowmaps to design them, 
                    as you can see from my choice of Vidyard. 
                    Based on my experience in healthcare and my girlfriend's experience working in 
                    healthcare and informing me about the antiquated processes and technology they utilize, I kind of put two and two together on spot. I  thought about how vidyard or any other short video app could be used as a reference point and can improve patient care by the doctor simply sending them an email by what their patient may be diagnosed with and an explanation of what it is, what they may be prescribed, and why, thus reducing workload and not requiring a patient and go through a complicated process in order to reach their doctor, and based on my experience sometimes I would stay longer than usual and I was time sensitive so whenever the doctor was finished with me I was in a rush so anything told to me by the doctor I just yes him to death to just leave because I maybe late to something. 
                    So that is why I choose them. </p>
                    
                    <p> On the Friday which was the last day I recieved a congratulatory letter and also my certificate of graduation regarding my graduation from Uvaro.
                        <div class="C25"><image src="cert.png"> <image src="Complete letter.png"></image></div></p>
                    <p>We also had a very rapid fire review the last day and we applied and performed everything we learned.
                    Furthermore, as a Uvaro gruduate I have learned a lot more than I expected to about the tech industry and even saas itself as I pursue my computer science degree I definitly want experience 
                    on the sales side because I can see the potential of how lucrative things can get and mixing and match my skills with coding. However, I am aware I still have a lot to learn and experience. 
                    Furthermore, I was able to create a network within the Uvaro community, and learned to appreciate sales in a different light. Currently I am trying to find internships and also job offerings from Vidyard and or Salesforce to
                    gain more experience in sales and the tech industry in general as I know I have a lot to offer. For those wondering if they should take the course I recommend it as it is something 
                    beneficial and can be to your sales career. Thank you for reading!
