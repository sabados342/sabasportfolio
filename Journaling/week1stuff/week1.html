         <p> Class is in session on ZOOM! The first week was an eye opener. I remember I kinda had an idea of what SAAS sales were and what the roles and positions were but, I was still unsure , on the first day I remember we all as a cohort were from different parts of the US and Canada. We were welcomed by our sociable, and friendly course instructor Sheila Wung. She basically introduced herself and got to know us on why we decided to switch or even decided to pursue this route.  She likewise acquainted how we were going with help the week and furthermore terms, and she addressed any inquiries we had. Sheila likewise went over Uvaro's statement of purpose, and furthermore the way things were established and related it to us and where we are and brought up the potential open doors and entryways that you can open.

         her talked and also we introduced ourselves in the first 20 minutes, she also was answering our questions I was able to understand her story and gain insight, it also made me feel like I wasn't alone in the midst of what was going on in my personal life, and also
        to what was to come this week. Sheila likewise showed us this for us to relate and make associations with comprehend we have these abilities from past work encounters and that these are the abilities that the tech business head honchos or chiefs are searching for in a SDR(Sales Development Representative) or BDR (Business Development Representative) <div class= "pic1" ><img src="Codeofconduct.png" alt="Program"/> </div> </p>
        <p> We were presented on the thing we would cover this approaching week, and how the patterns of saas deals functions how we will figure out how to make, and keep a clean pipeline. Some other key action items she referenced were about the feeling of detachment between our selves and our careers. <div class="pic1"><image src="programpillar.png" alt="Programpillar"/> </p></div> <p>Then she went over the tools we will be using, and also their significance and purpose. She went over zoom for content delivery, and using it to work in groups and interact. Although I was aware of Zoom and it's purpose like everyone in the cohort she also introduced us to
            Slack for connecting with others in the community of the tech industry and also Uvaro, this included alumni, my cohort, or staff. An app called Vidyard and it's innovative use, and purpose for how for personal video creation and I was open and also learned how this is a very useful tool for finding prospects. Google slides for powerpoint presentation when we did the weekly assignment, uvaro personal app KIITE playbooks Kiite, a product organization zeroed in aiding outreach groups catch, sort out and share their recorded and ancestral information, which was publicly launched its first Uvaro Sales Training on January 13, in the wake of getting in excess of 800 applications to join the program. 
            Sheila gave a great deal of understanding on devices and simply the idea of how things work and how it depends on a cycle that we can learn and execute join it with our involvement with occupations connected with client care and the distinction relating to how we track down ideal up-and-comers and how to carry out them. She likewise broke the shame for me when somebody hears a money manager and afterward old fashioned viewpoints of how somebody is active and extroverted, me being a contemplative person or an introvert gave me more trust in understanding what to do and who I will manage. Additionally on the grounds that all individuals manage others how the deals are exceptionally mental in this point I enjoyed a benefit because of perusing books by Chris Voss "Never Split the distinction" and furthermore "Impact: Science and Practice
" by Robert Cialdini. <div class="pic1"><image src="careerpath.png" alt="careerpath"/> </div> <p>We also went over Career paths as an Sales Development Rep or Business Development Rep and made comparisons to careers that have the same paygrade but takes much longer to achieve.  <div class="pic1"><image src="careerpaths.png" alt="Careerpath"/> </div> <p>We learned about buyers personas  , communication norms <div class= "pic1" ><img src="COMNORMS.png" alt="Program"/> </div> <p>, and what an ICP is, <div class="pic1"><image src="ICP.png" alt="careerpath"/> </div> </p> <p>and also how it is implemented as a means to find the ideal customers to pursue for whatever SAAS is used. Futhermore, we also were presented some good examples of discovery questions, and why 
    we should implement linkedin, and to use it to our advantage to land roles but also find prospect through the actual career in order to make connections to close deals. It was really interesting because as I said before it gave me insight and perspective to see how a tech start up or any tech company can expand their business by finding their ideal customers and using data in order to break down from preventing finding the wrong person based on analytics. </p> <p> In Short on the last day of the week we were introduced to a guest speaker by the name of Spencer Blake we went over comapanies that are partnered with Uvaro and also offering internships. He was very informative and engaging it as was Sheila it motivated me and made me realize there's a lot I can learn from these two by just picking their brains on slack and linkedin.  <div class="pic1"><image src="companies.png" alt="companypath"/> </div>  </p>
</p>  <p> Finally this was our homework over the weekend, <div class="pic1"><image src="Assignment w1.png" alt="careerpath"/> </div> <p>it was cool because I really got to understand and also play with vidyard making over 1000 videos because I wanted perfection. However Sheila assured me a way to not overcomplicate things. Each week became more productive than the previous and as we dug deeper through the weeks I found out more and gain knowledge, likewise it gave me certainty and a superior comprehension of the dynamic express that the tech business underlies. </p>
