            <p>Week 2 - <b>note to self we got through week 1.</b> Week 2 was straight to business since from the first week we were able to be on each other's frequency and I had adjusted to the scheduled 12-2pm
                zoom calls. After catching up with us and checking where we are at Sheila got straight down to business as usual. So we started to learn about the concepts of Cadences and how it is
                implemented on the sales cycle in tech. First we analyzed and dissected the anatomy of cadences. This caused me to comprehend how it scales into how you approach a client and hit numerous touch focuses. 
                It likewise caused me to figure out how careful this approach is, I thought you must be fastidious with coding yet this made me know the amount you can utilize information for your potential benefit and have a structure that will help you scale 
                and track down your fantasy clients, and through that information that you get can bring about boosting in commitment, and furthermore it can assist with hitting your income. <div class="pic1"><image src="Anatomyofcadence.png" alt="Cadences"/> <image src="Howcadence.png" alt="cademces2"/> </div> 
                <p>Sheila also illustrated how salesloft is deployed in sales engagements through using samples of her approaches on early-career prospects as well as Uvaro Grads. She told us about the Lavender and Grammarly extensions. 
                    This was definitely an eyeopener to grasp how pipelines, and also how this app or tool is used to identify or close deals more effectively because of its adaptability in terms of how data can be captured, how well jobs can be prioritized, 
                    and how well it assists on analytics and observed how this would also improve cadences, automatically. It also made me appreciate how the tech industry has implemented the scientific approach through trial and error,

                    <p>On Wednesday, we were greeted by an instructor named James Howell, who, like Sheila, gave us a warm welcome. He told us what he had done and what he had been up to, 
                        and he reassured me that I could and would put my ideas into action. We spoke about frameworks and how to make them more efficient, as well as how to deal with objections. Cadences, as well as objection handling 
                        and how it should be applied, this brought me a new viewpoint on how to implement it physiologically and how successful that is and how it can even be implemented to non tech businesses. <div class="Pic1"><image src="Framework.png"/></div>   </p>
                        <p> I was able to learn how the flow of communication should be done through objection and how to handle it thanks to Sheila and James.</p><p>We also learned about MEDPICC and B.A.N.T ideas and how they're being used to a framework. The concepts was very beneficial in terms of executing and organizing it, which led to me adjusting more to the layouts utilized by seeing 
                            how it'd be more likely to get a better rate of response than not using the procedure to individual frameworks to target prospects. </p><div class="Pic2"><image src="Salesfunnel.png"/><image src="qualification.png"/><image src="BANT.png"/></div>
                            <p>Finally, we were introduced by a guest speaker who is also an Alumni for Uvaro, by name of Alyx Park who very kind, helpful, and full of a lot of positivity and also
                                meeting her and listening to her backstory and kinda where is she at right now just gave me perspective. She also coordinates their other program which is 
                                Career accerlerator. 
                                This whole week I learned so many more concepts and how they are utilized but I also recognized it potential and worth. Finally, this week we were given another 
                                assignment where we had to developments cadences based on their format and applying what we learned. <div class="pic1"><image src="Assignment2.png"/></div>
