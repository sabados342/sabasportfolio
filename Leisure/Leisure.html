        <h1>Personal Life</h1>

        <p>I believe all events and experiences we are or were involved in can dictate our thought paterrns in how we think, I think lesiure is a must
            and hobbies, my preferences are usually stimulating because it keeps me very occupied.
            It's reasonable to say that I seldom have spare time since, if I'm not working, I'm generally engaged in a hobby or talent that I like. 
             I enjoy playing with my kitties and living with those two although sometimes they give me headaches and are crazy interesting characters I love them they are so 
              funny and interestingly weird. They are their own species. The grey cat is named Mr.Pickles he is a russian blue and he's 9 months now this picture of him is taken when he was 6months. As he loves to hang off things with
              his arms out its really cute. The little one her name is Sagwa named afer the cat in the show because she is so hyper and troublesome and getting into trouble all the time shes 3 weeks younger than Mr.Pickles.<div class="b21"><image src="Pickles.png"></image><image src="Sagwa.jpg"></image></imagr></div> </p>
              <p> I also usually read and am currently reading about computational thinking
             because I find that mindset to be very interesting. I already possess this skill, but I want to keep honing it because I think it's 
             really interesting how someone can look at something and then create a set of steps in order toÂ solve the issue.
             I use love tv sitcoms and watch them everything from the honeymooners as a child to The Big Bang Theory
             growing up I have watched Fresh Prince of Bel air, Saved by the bell, Wayne brothers, My wife and kids, Married with childred,Friends, Seinfield, Everybody Loves Raymond
             , Everybody Hates Chris, Bernie Mac Show, The simpsons, Family Guy, South Park , American Dad, Spongebob Drake and Josh and more
             but now I watch anime if I watch anything currently finishing "Japan sinks" I have watched the classics DBZ, Naruto, One piece(never finished),Guran Lagan, Death Note, Great Teacher Onizuka 
             Inuyasha, I just love how deep and relatable the story is. People typically have this stigma anime is jsut a bunch of Cartoons throwing weapons at eachother, but when you watch it you see how deep the stories are
             and also the feelings they portray and how real it is. I also am a major fan of Hiphop and rap grew up listening to the greats classics Tupac, Biggie, Wutang, 50 cent, Jay z, lil wayne, big daddy kane, LL cool J, NWA, ice cube, Run dmc,
             Dr dre, Krs one, Big addy Kane , Doug E Fresh, De la soul I also listen to almost every rapper who are even currently in the rao game today although most songs I dont like because the meaning is garbage and has no substance the ones that do "
            are the same ones  I listen to I love to paint and also do arts and craft currently working on an anatomical heart with paper mache, ballon , and also created how it will stand. It actually has been 
            taking me time to make becasue you see the packing peanuts and how I glued them together? That is the part I keep having to redo because of how wet the packing peanuts get. When I have the time and I am not studying or coding 
            I try to work on it. These are some of my paintings as well. I find it very therapetic and it keeps your mind clear but focused, I also work out I do calesthetics and I have a little pull up/dip machine my girlfriend got me. To me phsyical, mental, spirtual, and emotional
            health are very very significant for anyone in life and for anything they do.  I like to hang out with my friends and family members when I have the time to. I love to read on CNBC for economic news and also watch charts and compare them by using technical Analysis. If you made it to the end thank you for 
            taking your time reading. <div class="n21"><image src="heartz.jpg" > </image><image src="paiinting.jpg"> <image src="paiting44.jpg"></image></image></div>  </p>
